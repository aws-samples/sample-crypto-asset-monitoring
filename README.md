## üîÑ 3. Technical Implementation Details

This solution implements a comprehensive monitoring pipeline for crypto assets:

### Data Flow Architecture

The solution implements a comprehensive monitoring pipeline with four distinct layers:

1. **Detection Layer**:
   - **AWS CloudTrail** captures all API activity related to crypto assets
   - **AWS Config** rules (implemented as AWS Lambda functions) continuously evaluate crypto assets against best practices
   - **AWS Security Hub** provides additional security checks and standards compliance evaluation

2. **Collection Layer**:
   - **AWS Security Hub** centralizes and normalizes findings from AWS Config rules
   - **AWS Security Lake** stores security data for long-term analysis and querying

3. **Analysis Layer**:
   - **Amazon Athena** queries extract specific insights from AWS Security Lake data
   - Queries target security findings, usage patterns, and compliance status of crypto assets

4. **Visualization Layer**:
   - **Amazon QuickSight** dashboards transform analyzed data into visual insights
   - Interactive visualizations help identify security issues, optimize costs, and ensure compliance

### AWS Config Rules Implementation

The custom AWS Config rules are implemented as AWS Lambda functions in Python:

- **AWS KMS Unused Keys Detection**: The `check_unused_keys.py` AWS Lambda function evaluates AWS KMS keys that haven't been used for a configurable period (default 90 days). It uses the AWS KMS API to check the `LastUsedDate` of each key and marks keys as non-compliant if they exceed the threshold.

  ```python
  # Example from check_unused_keys.py
  def evaluate_key(kms, key_id, now):
      metadata = kms.describe_key(KeyId=key_id)['KeyMetadata']
      
      # Skip keys that are not customer-managed or not enabled
      if metadata['KeyManager'] != 'CUSTOMER' or metadata['KeyState'] != 'Enabled':
          return None
      
      last_used_date = metadata.get('LastUsedDate')
      if not last_used_date:
          compliance = 'NON_COMPLIANT'
          annotation = "Key has never been used."
      else:
          age = (now - last_used_date.replace(tzinfo=None)).days
          if age > THRESHOLD_DAYS:
              compliance = 'NON_COMPLIANT'
              annotation = f"Key has not been used for {age} days."
          else:
              compliance = 'COMPLIANT'
              annotation = f"Key used {age} days ago."
  ```

- **AWS Secrets Manager Unused Secrets**: The `unusedSecret.py` AWS Lambda function identifies secrets that haven't been accessed. It checks the `LastAccessedDate` of each secret and marks secrets as non-compliant if they haven't been accessed.

- **AWS Certificate Manager Validation**: The certificate validation AWS Lambda function checks for certificates with pending DNS validation, helping you identify certificates that may need attention.

### CloudFormation Templates

The solution includes multi-region AWS CloudFormation templates designed to be deployed as StackSets:

- Templates create the necessary AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles with least-privilege permissions
- AWS Lambda functions are embedded directly in the templates for easy deployment
- AWS Config rules are configured to run on a schedule (default: every 24 hours)
- Parameters allow customization of thresholds and other settings

### Athena Queries

The Amazon Athena queries are designed to work with the AWS Security Lake schema:

- Queries target the `amazon_security_lake_table_*_sh_findings_2_0` tables
- They extract specific fields related to crypto assets and their compliance status
- Results can be filtered by account, region, time period, and other dimensions

### ‚öôÔ∏è 4.2 Config Rules Deployment

This example includes sample AWS Config rules for detecting unused crypto assets. You can deploy these rules using CloudFormation StackSets to apply them across your organization, and modify them to meet your specific requirements.

#### KMS Unused Keys Detection

1. Navigate to the CloudFormation console
2. Create a new StackSet using the template: `config-rules/kms/kms-unused-multiregion.yaml`
3. Deploy the StackSet to all accounts in your organization
4. The Lambda function `config-rules/kms/check_unused_keys.py` will be deployed to evaluate KMS keys

The KMS unused keys detection rule works as follows:
- The Lambda function runs on a schedule (every 24 hours by default)
- It lists all KMS keys in the account and region
- For each customer-managed key, it checks the `LastUsedDate` metadata
- Keys that haven't been used for more than the threshold period (90 days by default) are marked as non-compliant
- Findings are sent to AWS Config and forwarded to Security Hub

You can customize the threshold period by modifying the `ThresholdDays` parameter in the CloudFormation template:

```yaml
Parameters:
  ThresholdDays:
    Type: Number
    Default: 90
    Description: Number of days after which an unused KMS key is considered non-compliant
    MinValue: 1
    MaxValue: 365
```

#### Secrets Manager Unused Secrets Detection

1. Navigate to the CloudFormation console
2. Create a new StackSet using the template: `config-rules/secretsManager/unusedSecretsConfigRule-multiregion.yaml`
3. Deploy the StackSet to all accounts in your organization
4. The Lambda function `config-rules/secretsManager/unusedSecret.py` will be deployed to evaluate Secrets Manager secrets

The Secrets Manager unused secrets detection rule:
- Evaluates all secrets in the account and region
- Checks the `LastAccessedDate` of each secret
- Marks secrets that have never been accessed or haven't been accessed recently as non-compliant
- Includes creation and last accessed dates in the finding annotation

### üîç 4.3 Athena Queries Setup

This example includes sample Athena queries for analyzing crypto asset usage and security events. These queries are provided as starting points that you can customize and extend. They are organized by service:

- **AWS KMS Queries** (`athena-queries/kms/`):
  - `kms-access-denied.sql`: Identifies access denied events for AWS KMS keys
  - `kms-keys-without-autorotation.sql`: Identifies AWS KMS keys without automatic rotation enabled
  - `kms-operation.sql`: Analyzes AWS KMS operation patterns
  - `kms-unused-cmks.sql`: Identifies potentially unused customer master keys

- **AWS Certificate Manager Queries** (`athena-queries/certs/`):
  - `cert-dns-validation-pending.sql`: Identifies certificates with pending DNS validation
  - `cert-expiring-check.sql`: Identifies certificates that are expiring soon
  - `cert-operation-brkdown.sql`: Analyzes certificate operation patterns
  - `certs-issued.sql`: Lists certificates that have been issued
  - `certs-revoked.sql`: Lists certificates that have been revoked

- **AWS Secrets Manager Queries** (`athena-queries/secretsManager/`):
  - `sm-access-denied.sql`: Identifies access denied events for secrets
  - `sm-deleted.sql`: Lists secrets that have been deleted
  - `sm-get-ops.sql`: Analyzes secret retrieval operations
  - `sm-operations-brkdwn.sql`: Analyzes AWS Secrets Manager operation patterns
  - `sm-rotation-not-enabled.sql`: Identifies secrets without rotation enabled
  - `sm-unused-secrets.sql`: Identifies potentially unused secrets

These queries are designed to work with the Security Lake schema. For example, the `kms-unused-cmks.sql` query:

```sql
SELECT
  accountid,
  region,
  time_dt AS finding_time,
  REGEXP_EXTRACT(observables[1].value, 'arn:aws:kms:[^"]+') AS kms_arn,
  compliance.status AS compliance_status,
  unmapped['ProductFields.aws/config/ConfigRuleName'] AS config_rule_name,
  finding_info.created_time_dt AS config_evaluation_time
FROM amazon_security_lake_glue_db_us_east_1.amazon_security_lake_table_us_east_1_sh_findings_2_0
WHERE
  finding_info.title = 'kms-unused-key-check'
  AND compliance.status = 'FAILED';
```

This query:
- Targets the AWS Security Lake findings table
- Filters for findings from the AWS KMS unused keys AWS Config rule
- Extracts key information like account ID, region, AWS KMS ARN, and evaluation time
- Focuses on non-compliant findings (status = 'FAILED')

To use these queries:
1. Navigate to the Amazon Athena console
2. Ensure that Amazon Athena is configured to query your AWS Security Lake data
3. Copy and paste the desired query from the appropriate file
4. Run the query and analyze the results
5. Save the query results as a dataset for use in Amazon QuickSight
