A sample solution for monitoring and securing AWS crypto assets across your organization using AWS Security services, Athena queries, and QuickSight dashboards. This example provides a foundation that you can customize and build upon to meet your specific requirements.

## üîê 1. Project Overview

AWS Crypto Asset Monitoring provides an example framework for monitoring the security and usage of cryptographic assets across your AWS organization. This sample solution demonstrates how you can identify unused or misconfigured KMS keys, certificates, and Secrets Manager secrets, helping you maintain proper security hygiene and optimize costs.

By leveraging AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, Security Hub, Security Lake, Athena, and QuickSight, this example solution demonstrates:

- How to gain visibility into crypto asset usage across your organization
- Methods for automated detection of security issues and compliance violations
- Examples of interactive dashboards for monitoring and reporting
- Sample AWS Config rules for detecting unused crypto assets that you can adapt to your needs

## üß© 2. Solution Components

This example solution consists of the following components that you can customize and extend:

- **AWS CloudTrail**: Captures API activity related to crypto assets
- **AWS Config Rules**: Custom rules to detect unused or misconfigured crypto assets, you can use this pattern to create more config rules to meet your needs.
  - KMS unused keys detection
  - Secrets Manager unused secrets detection
  - Certificates pending DNS validation
- **AWS Security Hub**: Centralizes findings from AWS Config rules
- **AWS Security Lake**: Stores and normalizes security data for analysis

### ‚öôÔ∏è 4.2 Config Rules Deployment

This example includes sample AWS Config rules for detecting unused crypto assets. You can deploy these rules using CloudFormation StackSets to apply them across your organization, and modify them to meet your specific requirements.

#### KMS Unused Keys Detection

1. Navigate to the CloudFormation console
2. Create a new StackSet using the template: `config-rules/kms/kms-unused-multiregion.yaml`
3. Deploy the StackSet to all accounts in your organization
4. The Lambda function `config-rules/kms/check_unused_keys.py` will be deployed to evaluate KMS keys

#### Secrets Manager Unused Secrets Detection

1. Navigate to the CloudFormation console
2. Create a new StackSet using the template: `config-rules/secretsManager/unusedSecretsConfigRule-multiregion.yaml`
3. Deploy the StackSet to all accounts in your organization
4. The Lambda function `config-rules/secretsManager/unusedSecret.py` will be deployed to evaluate Secrets Manager secrets

### üîç 4.3 Athena Queries Setup

This example includes sample Athena queries for analyzing crypto asset usage and security events. These queries are provided as starting points that you can customize and extend. They are organized by service:

- **KMS Queries** (`athena-queries/kms/`):
  - `kms-access-denied.sql`: Identifies access denied events for KMS keys
  - `kms-keys-without-autorotation.sql`: Identifies KMS keys without automatic rotation enabled
  - `kms-operation.sql`: Analyzes KMS operation patterns
  - `kms-unused-cmks.sql`: Identifies potentially unused customer master keys

- **Certificate Manager Queries** (`athena-queries/certs/`):
  - `cert-dns-validation-pending.sql`: Identifies certificates with pending DNS validation
  - `cert-expiring-check.sql`: Identifies certificates that are expiring soon
  - `cert-operation-brkdown.sql`: Analyzes certificate operation patterns
  - `certs-issued.sql`: Lists certificates that have been issued
  - `certs-revoked.sql`: Lists certificates that have been revoked

- **Secrets Manager Queries** (`athena-queries/secretsManager/`):
  - `sm-access-denied.sql`: Identifies access denied events for secrets
  - `sm-deleted.sql`: Lists secrets that have been deleted
  - `sm-get-ops.sql`: Analyzes secret retrieval operations
  - `sm-operations-brkdwn.sql`: Analyzes Secrets Manager operation patterns

  - `sm-unused-secrets.sql`: Identifies potentially unused secrets

To use these queries:
1. Navigate to the Athena console
2. Ensure that Athena is configured to query your Security Lake data
3. Copy and paste the desired query from the appropriate file
4. Run the query and analyze the results

## üìñ 5. Usage Guide

This section provides guidance on how you might use and extend this example solution to meet your specific monitoring needs.

### Interpreting the Dashboards

The QuickSight dashboards provide insights into the following areas:

- **KMS Key Usage**: Monitor key usage patterns, identify unused keys, and detect access denied events
- **Certificate Management**: Track certificate expirations, validations, and issuance/revocation patterns
- **Secrets Manager Usage**: Monitor secret usage patterns, identify unused secrets, and detect access denied events

### Common Monitoring Scenarios

- **Identifying Unused Crypto Assets**: Use the dashboards to identify KMS keys and secrets that haven't been used in a specified period
- **Detecting Access Issues**: Monitor access denied events to identify potential permission issues
- **Certificate Lifecycle Management**: Track certificate expirations and ensure timely renewal
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensure crypto assets are configured according to best practices (e.g., rotation enabled)

### Responding to Alerts

When the dashboards or AWS Config rules identify issues:

1. Review the details of the finding in Security Hub
2. Investigate the root cause using the provided information
3. Take appropriate remediation actions (e.g., update permissions, rotate secrets, renew certificates)
4. Document the incident and resolution for compliance purposes

## üîß 6. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

As you implement and customize this example solution, you might encounter the following issues:

- **Missing Data in Dashboards**:
  - Verify that CloudTrail is properly configured and logging to Security Lake
